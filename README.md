## Introduction

The Weather Details project demonstrates how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration can be used together to create an interactive and dynamic weather application. The app provides users with real-time weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, for any location.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML* - Markup language for structuring the weather app interface.
- *CSS* - Used for styling the application’s layout and design.
- *JavaScript* - Handles interactivity, API requests, and data rendering.
- *Weather API* - Provides real-time weather data for different locations.
  
## Usage

   *The weather data is fetched dynamically using an API based on the user’s input location. Users can enter the name of a city to view its current weather, including temperature, humidity, and other details.
